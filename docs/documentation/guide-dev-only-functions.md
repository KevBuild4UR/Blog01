These features are originally available to R* developers, with this Tool, you can access to them in your content creator.

## Place freely in the interior

In developer mode, you are free to set props, vehicles and other variables in any restricted area.

## Load & Enter IPLs

There is an unnamed tab in the "Survival Details" option of the survival creator. After entering the tab, you need to select the third or the fourth option to load IPLs (the third tab is exteriors and the fourth tab is interiors) in a survival.

### Enter the interior
You can directly enter the interior by pressing the "Space" key (Keyboard) or "X" key (Controller) under the enabled interior options, or you can teleport into the interior through the first-person "Cycle Items" option in developer mode. This is impossible in the current ordinary creator. (These interiors are generally not loaded in the game, in the survival creator you will be free to choose whether to enable these interiors)

The first step is to enter the first-person view, and use the "Override Position" to move the props to the interior, After the settings are completed, the props will be used as a waypoint.

The second step is to select the "Cycle Items" option to switch to the prop you set to be used as a waypoint.

The third step is to remove the prop or select the prop to enter the collision-free state. At this time, you have successfully entered the loaded interior. If you were not teleport to the waypoint prop you set after teleporting, but were teleported to the surface, the reason is probably that the interior has not been loaded yet. If multiple attempts still fail, please try to save the job and reload it or start a test (the purpose is to reload the online contents).

## Create a super long distance Transform Race warp checkpoint

First of all, place a warp checkpoint and its destination checkpoint, and a checkpoint you need to use as the real destination. After the placement, you only need to delete the checkpoint associated with the warp checkpoint. After that, the remaining checkpoint will become the destination.

When you encounter a situation where you cannot place the team start point or spawn point, just press and hold "Delete" on your keyboard to continue placing it (be careful when using it on props).
